    <h1>January/February 2015 Reading List</h1>
    <br>
    

<p>One of my goals for 2015 is to read 2 books a month.  I made this goal towards the end of the January, so I&rsquo;m pretty pleased to say I got one book done in January, and <em>two</em> in the first seven days of February. Now I just need to finish another one to get my average back on track. I&rsquo;ve been getting copies of these books from my local library. The great thing about my library is that it is a part of a system of libraries that make it easy to borrow books from any library in the area. It really expands the number of books I have at my disposal.</p>

<h3 id="rework-remote:d60164a73e516b5e526672678dfb4449">Rework &amp; Remote</h3>

<p>In January I read <a href="https://37signals.com/rework">Rework</a>, and followed it up with <a href="https://37signals.com/remote">Remote</a>, both by the founders of <a href="https://37signals.com">37signals</a> Both of these books are a pretty easy read, a collection of short essays more than anything. Also each essay comes with a nifty illustration. My favorite line from either book is</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A stuffed backlog is a stale backlog&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This really hit home for me as a Scrum Master. Our backlog is packed with stuff that we&rsquo;ll get to &ldquo;some day&rdquo;. Using your backlog for a place to capture ideas is doing it wrong.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say there&rsquo;s anything revolutionary about either of these books, but they are a both a solid, quick read, worth your time if you work in the Tech Industry. It looks like they have a third book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Real-Smarter-Successful-Application/dp/0578012812/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1423358012&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=getting+real+37+signals">Getting Real</a> that I&rsquo;ll probably check out.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-win-friends-influence-people:d60164a73e516b5e526672678dfb4449">How to Win Friends &amp; Influence People</h3>

<p>The other book I finished in February was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Friends-Influence-People-Revised/dp/067142517X/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1423357609&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=how+to+win+friends+and+influence+people">How to Win Friends &amp; Influence People</a>. I find this book on lots of people&rsquo;s &ldquo;must read&rdquo; lists. And I can understand why: the book is good at teaching you things you should just know. The book teaches through many, many anecdotes that lead to a single principle for each chapter.</p>

<p>I found this book helpful in changing how I communicate with others. I&rsquo;ve always thought of myself as someone who lives by the Golden Rule:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Do unto others as you would have done unto yourself.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the problem is, how I like to be treated is irrelevant when talking with other people. I like my conversations to be short and to the point, and let logic prevail. That&rsquo;s not really what communication is all about for most people. This book has helped me really understand that. I&rsquo;ll probably need to re-read this one every few months to keep myself from sliding back to my very direct conversational style.</p>
