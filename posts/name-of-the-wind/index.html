    <h1>name of the wind</h1>
    <br>
    <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Name-Wind-Kingkiller-Chronicle/dp/0756404746">The Name of the Wind</a> by Patrick Rothfuss is the first of a 3 part fantasy series. The book is the &ldquo;Day One&rdquo; telling of a three day story by the books main character.</p>

<p>This book in the series is very much an &ldquo;origin story&rdquo; about how the main character, Kvothe, grew up and came to be famous. We get glimpses of the glory this young man is destined for, but we&rsquo;re never introduced specifically to what makes him worth of a 3 day story telling binge. Kvothe evidently grows up to be one of the world&rsquo;s most famous magicians, but we don&rsquo;t get quite that far in the first book.</p>

<p>The story was slow going for me in the first few chapters, as I wasn&rsquo;t sure what we were building to. However, once the Kvothe starts telling his story in his words, the pace picks up quite a bit and things get interesting.</p>

<p>The story reminds me a bit of another young lad with a predisposition to magic, Harry Potter. Both are orphans that suffer much through their childhoods, and both prove to be vary proficient with magic and a school that teaches just that!</p>

<p>However, Kvothe is not just a magician, the school he attends actually teaches him how to survive in the real world, such as acting as a doctor, or a craftsman. Magic in this part of the story is relegated mostly to <em>Sympathy</em>, willing the mind to control things. This of course if an over simplification of everything, and perhaps I&rsquo;ll get better after finishing the serious.</p>

<p>The title of the book refers to some <em>true</em> magic that Kvothe manifests out of anger. I think the next book might deal with how he comes to actually have control of that ability. The &ldquo;Name of the Wind&rdquo; is just one of many &ldquo;Names&rdquo; in the world - as all things have &ldquo;Names&rdquo; that can be called.</p>

<p>Once I got going on this book, I couldn&rsquo;t put it down. It was well written, and the character development is phenomenal for the main character, but most other characters are given less time. I guess this makes sense - the main character is the one telling the story, and we all love to talk about ourselves.</p>
