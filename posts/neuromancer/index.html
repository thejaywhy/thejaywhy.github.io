    <h1>Enter the Matrix... err &#39;Neuromancer&#39;</h1>
    <br>
    <p>A co-worker recently turned me on to William Gibson&rsquo;s 1986 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Neuromancer-William-Gibson/dp/0441569595">Neuromancer</a>, a Sci-Fi novel that ended up having quite the influence on the genre as a whole.</p>

<p>The beginning of the book (and much of the middle) was a little confusing to me at times, as Gibson would drop technical expressions like we already knew what they were. Even if he quite clearly made them up. So I was left wondering just what the heck he was talking about. Somethings would get explained later, but most were not - even the important details. Perhaps if I had read his earlier works, things would have been much clearer. I&rsquo;m not a big enough fan of his writing style to go investigate though.</p>

<p>The plot of the story centers around a junkie/hacker who is employed by a mysterious individual to bring about the destruction of a certain corporation&rsquo;s servers. In the end we discover that it is all orchestrated by an Artificial Intelligence - living within those servers. The main character releases the AI into the world, and at various points in <em>the matrix</em>, the AI even presents itself as a human. Still far fetched by today&rsquo;s standards, right?</p>

<p>The book does introduce some interesting concepts though. Things such as plugging directly into <em>The Matrix</em>, or <em>cyberspace</em>. And even the ability to be connected wireless-ly to the network. While we haven&rsquo;t quite reached the same virtual world as described in the book, mobile devices certainly keep us attached.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help visualizing parts of the films <em>The Matrix</em>, <em>Hackers</em>, and <em>Johnny Mnemonic</em> while reading this book. Turns out, Gibson was the author of <em>Johnny Mnemonic</em> as well! I&rsquo;d recommend this book just to see the origin of some of the details that influenced Sci-Fi in the years after it was released.</p>
