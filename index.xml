&lt;p&gt;One of my goals for 2015 is to read 2 books a month. I made this goal towards the end of the January, so I&amp;rsquo;m pretty pleased to say I got one book done in January, and &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; in the first seven days of February. Now I just need to finish another one to get my average back on track. I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting copies of these books from my local library. The great thing about my library is that it is a part of a system of libraries that make it easy to borrow books from any library in the area. It really expands the number of books I have at my disposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;rework-remote:d60164a73e516b5e526672678dfb4449&#34;&gt;Rework &amp;amp; Remote&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January I read &lt;a href=&#34;https://37signals.com/rework&#34;&gt;Rework&lt;/a&gt;, and followed it up with &lt;a href=&#34;https://37signals.com/remote&#34;&gt;Remote&lt;/a&gt;, both by the founders of &lt;a href=&#34;https://37signals.com&#34;&gt;37signals&lt;/a&gt; Both of these books are a pretty easy read, a collection of short essays more than anything. Also each essay comes with a nifty illustration. My favorite line from either book is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A stuffed backlog is a stale backlog&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This really hit home for me as a Scrum Master. Our backlog is packed with stuff that we&amp;rsquo;ll get to &amp;ldquo;some day&amp;rdquo;. Using your backlog for a place to capture ideas is doing it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say there&amp;rsquo;s anything revolutionary about either of these books, but they are a both a solid, quick read, worth your time if you work in the Tech Industry. It looks like they have a third book, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Real-Smarter-Successful-Application/dp/0578012812/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1423358012&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=getting+real+37+signals&#34;&gt;Getting Real&lt;/a&gt; that I&amp;rsquo;ll probably check out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-win-friends-influence-people:d60164a73e516b5e526672678dfb4449&#34;&gt;How to Win Friends &amp;amp; Influence People&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other book I finished in February was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/How-Friends-Influence-People-Revised/dp/067142517X/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1423357609&amp;amp;sr=1-5&amp;amp;keywords=how+to+win+friends+and+influence+people&#34;&gt;How to Win Friends &amp;amp; Influence People&lt;/a&gt;. I find this book on lots of people&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;must read&amp;rdquo; lists. And I can understand why: the book is good at teaching you things you should just know. The book teaches through many, many anecdotes that lead to a single principle for each chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this book helpful in changing how I communicate with others. I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought of myself as someone who lives by the Golden Rule:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do unto others as you would have done unto yourself.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the problem is, how I like to be treated is irrelevant when talking with other people. I like my conversations to be short and to the point, and let logic prevail. That&amp;rsquo;s not really what communication is all about for most people. This book has helped me really understand that. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably need to re-read this one every few months to keep myself from sliding back to my very direct conversational style.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Resolutions for 2015</title>

&lt;p&gt;Now that it is February, time to make some goals for myself in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;be-an-even-awesomer-husband-father:87223ae63adbc1cf20a73dc9414eb665&#34;&gt;Be an even awesomer Husband &amp;amp; Father&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to think I&amp;rsquo;m doing a pretty decent job at this already, but there&amp;rsquo;s always room for improvement. And our family will be expanding from 3 to 4 in 2015!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;make-a-blog-and-keep-writing-for-it:87223ae63adbc1cf20a73dc9414eb665&#34;&gt;Make a blog&amp;hellip; and keep writing for it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, you&amp;rsquo;re here, so I&amp;rsquo;m doing pretty well so far. Of course, we&amp;rsquo;ll see if I can keep going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve written what I&amp;rsquo;ve got so far using &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty sweet static site generator written in &lt;a href=&#34;http://golang.org/&#34;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt;. I like that I can write everything in markdown. After using github for a couple of years, I have problems writing in anything other than Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;read-2-books-a-month:87223ae63adbc1cf20a73dc9414eb665&#34;&gt;Read 2 Books a Month&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year I averaged maybe 1 book a month. I read mostly fiction in 2014. In 2015 I&amp;rsquo;m looking to read both fiction and non-fiction. Ideally one of each type every month. Not sure how the other goals will affect this one. I plan to make time to read in the mornings, after I wake up. Hopefully the house will still be quiet at that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;re-implement-this-blog:87223ae63adbc1cf20a73dc9414eb665&#34;&gt;Re-Implement this blog&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is definitely a stretch goal, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to try re-implementing this blog using various frameworks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rails (no experience)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;django (some experience from work stuff)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;elixir (no experience)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;go &amp;amp; its magnificent stdlib (some experience)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, I&amp;rsquo;ll write the blog apps to intake the same markdown used by Hugo. And then take advantage of various CI/CD pipelines to deploy new posts too all the apps at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the log term plan becomes use DNS tricks to randomly send users to a different destination. They&amp;rsquo;ll only know what type of framework they are seeing by a &amp;ldquo;bug&amp;rdquo; in the footer. Sounds neat, right?&lt;/p&gt;
