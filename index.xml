      <title>Dad is Fat - Review</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently finished reading Jim Gaffigan&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Dad-Fat-Jim-Gaffigan/dp/0385349076/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1425148385&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=dad+is+fat&#34;&gt;Dad is Fat&lt;/a&gt;. It was a great read, I definitely laughed out loud every chapter. My wife was not amused. Reading this book put me back on track for my 2015 goal of 2 books a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is basically a collection of essays about how Gaffigan came to have a family with 5 children, living in a 2 bedroom apartment in NYC. That&amp;rsquo;s crazy, I only have 1 kid (so far) and that&amp;rsquo;s more than enough work. 5 kids? Working nights doing stand up? When does he sleep? He admits to not really ever sleeping. Still impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A general theme throughout the book is Gaffigan&amp;rsquo;s wife, Jeannie, and how she makes everything work (even his stand up). He even correctly refers to himself as just another one of the kids. I know my wife often thinks &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have two children, but at least I only have to change diapers for the&lt;/em&gt; actual &lt;em&gt;kid.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m in no hurry to grow up, especially when I&amp;rsquo;m spending time with kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite chapter of the book is where Gaffigan compares the role of the Dad to that of Vice President. A figurehead, with no real power. I often feel this way, my kid will &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; go for Mom. I really am just someone to play with. But I wonder if that&amp;rsquo;s because I spend so much time at work, instead of in the house? Gaffigan seems to spend a lot of time with his kids, but he&amp;rsquo;s still just VP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve got kids, and free time, you should definitely checkout &lt;em&gt;Dad is Fat&lt;/em&gt;. You&amp;rsquo;ll find a lot of stuff to relate to in there. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have kids, you&amp;rsquo;ll still find laughs, but you may be scared away from having kids for ever. Maybe even skip the whole marriage thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to reading Jim Gaffigan&amp;rsquo;s next book, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Food-Love-Story-Jim-Gaffigan/dp/0804140413/ref=pd_sim_b_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;refRID=1SGD8NJM1565YNSBCG4R&#34;&gt;Food: A Love Story&lt;/a&gt;. I will no doubt get a few dirty looks from my wife while I laugh my way through that book too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>January/February 2015 Reading List</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;One of my goals for 2015 is to read 2 books a month.  I made this goal towards the end of the January, so I&amp;rsquo;m pretty pleased to say I got one book done in January, and &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; in the first seven days of February. Now I just need to finish another one to get my average back on track. I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting copies of these books from my local library. The great thing about my library is that it is a part of a system of libraries that make it easy to borrow books from any library in the area. It really expands the number of books I have at my disposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;rework-remote:d60164a73e516b5e526672678dfb4449&#34;&gt;Rework &amp;amp; Remote&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January I read &lt;a href=&#34;https://37signals.com/rework&#34;&gt;Rework&lt;/a&gt;, and followed it up with &lt;a href=&#34;https://37signals.com/remote&#34;&gt;Remote&lt;/a&gt;, both by the founders of &lt;a href=&#34;https://37signals.com&#34;&gt;37signals&lt;/a&gt; Both of these books are a pretty easy read, a collection of short essays more than anything. Also each essay comes with a nifty illustration. My favorite line from either book is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A stuffed backlog is a stale backlog&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This really hit home for me as a Scrum Master. Our backlog is packed with stuff that we&amp;rsquo;ll get to &amp;ldquo;some day&amp;rdquo;. Using your backlog for a place to capture ideas is doing it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say there&amp;rsquo;s anything revolutionary about either of these books, but they are a both a solid, quick read, worth your time if you work in the Tech Industry. It looks like they have a third book, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Real-Smarter-Successful-Application/dp/0578012812/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1423358012&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=getting+real+37+signals&#34;&gt;Getting Real&lt;/a&gt; that I&amp;rsquo;ll probably check out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-win-friends-influence-people:d60164a73e516b5e526672678dfb4449&#34;&gt;How to Win Friends &amp;amp; Influence People&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other book I finished in February was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/How-Friends-Influence-People-Revised/dp/067142517X/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1423357609&amp;amp;sr=1-5&amp;amp;keywords=how+to+win+friends+and+influence+people&#34;&gt;How to Win Friends &amp;amp; Influence People&lt;/a&gt;. I find this book on lots of people&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;must read&amp;rdquo; lists. And I can understand why: the book is good at teaching you things you should just know. The book teaches through many, many anecdotes that lead to a single principle for each chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this book helpful in changing how I communicate with others. I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought of myself as someone who lives by the Golden Rule:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do unto others as you would have done unto yourself.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the problem is, how I like to be treated is irrelevant when talking with other people. I like my conversations to be short and to the point, and let logic prevail. That&amp;rsquo;s not really what communication is all about for most people. This book has helped me really understand that. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably need to re-read this one every few months to keep myself from sliding back to my very direct conversational style.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Resolutions for 2015</title>
      <link>http://randomjy.com/posts/resolutions-for-2015/</link>

&lt;p&gt;Now that it is February, time to make some goals for myself in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;be-an-even-awesomer-husband-father:87223ae63adbc1cf20a73dc9414eb665&#34;&gt;Be an even awesomer Husband &amp;amp; Father&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to think I&amp;rsquo;m doing a pretty decent job at this already, but there&amp;rsquo;s always room for improvement. And our family will be expanding from 3 to 4 in 2015!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;make-a-blog-and-keep-writing-for-it:87223ae63adbc1cf20a73dc9414eb665&#34;&gt;Make a blog&amp;hellip; and keep writing for it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, you&amp;rsquo;re here, so I&amp;rsquo;m doing pretty well so far. Of course, we&amp;rsquo;ll see if I can keep going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve written what I&amp;rsquo;ve got so far using &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty sweet static site generator written in &lt;a href=&#34;http://golang.org/&#34;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt;. I like that I can write everything in markdown. After using github for a couple of years, I have problems writing in anything other than Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;read-2-books-a-month:87223ae63adbc1cf20a73dc9414eb665&#34;&gt;Read 2 Books a Month&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year I averaged maybe 1 book a month. I read mostly fiction in 2014. In 2015 I&amp;rsquo;m looking to read both fiction and non-fiction. Ideally one of each type every month. Not sure how the other goals will affect this one. I plan to make time to read in the mornings, after I wake up. Hopefully the house will still be quiet at that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;re-implement-this-blog:87223ae63adbc1cf20a73dc9414eb665&#34;&gt;Re-Implement this blog&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is definitely a stretch goal, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to try re-implementing this blog using various frameworks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rails (no experience)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;django (some experience from work stuff)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;elixir (no experience)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;go &amp;amp; its magnificent stdlib (some experience)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, I&amp;rsquo;ll write the blog apps to intake the same markdown used by Hugo. And then take advantage of various CI/CD pipelines to deploy new posts too all the apps at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the log term plan becomes use DNS tricks to randomly send users to a different destination. They&amp;rsquo;ll only know what type of framework they are seeing by a &amp;ldquo;bug&amp;rdquo; in the footer. Sounds neat, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;person:6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47&#34;&gt;Person&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s up! Who am I? Why am I subjecting you to my random thoughts? Because we&amp;rsquo;re on the Internet, and I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off I&amp;rsquo;m married with 1 kid already and another on the way. My family is pretty awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe in doing as much as I can myself, so I like to build or improve things around our house. Plus, nothing will make you appreciate just how lucky you are more than doing manual labor. I dug dirt in the summers before college, it definitely motivated me to become an Engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In college I studied Computer Engineering &amp;amp; Software Engineering. After I worked in Embedded Systems, mostly coding up DSP type stuff in C. Although there were some deviations, including Java and Ada. Yes, Ada, and I liked it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now a days I work at &lt;a href=&#34;https//dyn.com&#34;&gt;Dyn&lt;/a&gt; working with &lt;a href=&#34;https://chef.io&#34;&gt;Chef&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.python.org/&#34;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.varnish-cache.org/&#34;&gt;Varnish&lt;/a&gt;. I serve as the Technical Owner &amp;amp; Scrum Master in our Agile/Scrum process. I am thoroughly enjoy working with my Squad as we build out a new SOA based web portal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m always looking to learn new things and improve on what I already know. This blog will hopefully capture that never ending journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;d like to contact me, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/random_jyoung&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://linkedin.com/in/jonryoung/&#34;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; would be best, Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tech:6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47&#34;&gt;Tech&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vim.org&#34;&gt;vim&lt;/a&gt; for everything. I have trouble using other editors that don&amp;rsquo;t natively support &lt;code&gt;h/j/k/l&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;powered by &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; (and isn&amp;rsquo;t it awesome?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Base theme is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zyro/hyde-x&#34;&gt;Hyde-X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further theme inspriation from &lt;a href=&#34;http://npf.io/&#34;&gt;npf.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
