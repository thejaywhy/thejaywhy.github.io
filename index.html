      <p>I re-read Scott Adams&rsquo; God&rsquo;s Debris: A Thought Experiment after 10 years. This book was a pretty profound read for me when I was in college - it really helped me define my relationship with religion. In college I thought it was the most amazing thing ever - but I was oh so young. Yes, this book is written by that Scott Adams, creator of Dilbert. This book has nothing to do with Dilbert.</p>

      <p>A co-worker recently turned me on to William Gibson&rsquo;s 1986 Neuromancer, a Sci-Fi novel that ended up having quite the influence on the genre as a whole. The beginning of the book (and much of the middle) was a little confusing to me at times, as Gibson would drop technical expressions like we already knew what they were. Even if he quite clearly made them up. So I was left wondering just what the heck he was talking about.</p>

      <p>Imagine that the author of web comic XKCD wrote a book. Now stop imagining - it&rsquo;s real. Randall Munroe wrote What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions and it&rsquo;s&hellip;. interesting. The book examines various scenarios that writers have submitted in various ways. Many questions are just too &ldquo;special&rdquo; to deal with, but others get a thorough examination. What I learned from reading this book is: we&rsquo;re all going to die.</p>

      <p>The second book from Jim Gaffigan is called, Food A Love Story - it&rsquo;s a great read if you want to be constantly hungry. The book is a tour of American cuisine through Gaffigan&rsquo;s eyes. He breaks the country up into various regions based on the type of food it is known for. Other parts of the world are occasionally thrown in. This is of course all based on his comedy touring.</p>

      <p>It’s summer time, and apparently that means I have less time for reading (the new kiddo may be affecting that as well). I am spending a lot of time outside doing yard work, so I’ve been making heavy use of audio books. In the past I’d listen to Pandora or NPR, but I think the audio book route is much more engaging. Recently I listened to Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose by Tony Hsieh.</p>

      <p>I recently had the privilege of reading Reinventing Organizations by Frederic Laloux - a book about the structure of organizations. This book looks at the various types of organizations in the work place, as well as a culture. I found it to be a fascinating read that really led me to reflect on how I bring my “self” to work. The book is broken down into 3 parts: Developmental Perspective Exploring Teal organizations (via Case Studies) Next Steps: Evolving to “Teal” In part 1, there is some background given on various levels of Human Consciousness and how they manifest within organizational structures.</p>

      <p>Dyn gives engineers a couple of days every quarter to work on “off roadmap” projects. During the most recent one, I worked on various small projects, this is one of them! I wanted to experiment with Terraform, a tool for making your infrastructure declarable - treating it just like your code. My example is simple, yet a great starting point; and I hope to expand on it soon. All I did was spin up a node and install NGINX.</p>

      <p>So, when you’ve got a newborn to take care off, reading is much harder. Luckily, there are audio books. I recently listened to Peter Theil &amp; Blake Masters&rsquo; Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future. I obtained this audio book via my local library, and the Overdrive app. This was my first experience with Overdrive, and it was OK. The app is a front to the overdrive website…and I have to keep signing in with my library card in addition to signing up for an Overdrive account.</p>

      <p>Have you heard of Vagrant? It&rsquo;s a pretty awesome way to manage VMs, containers, or even cloud instances. You can use the Vagrantfile to set up and configure the instance, check it into git, and share! Now you can rely on everyone to have the same starting point. Makes setting up development environments a breeze. And today I&rsquo;d like to share with you something I&rsquo;ve found to make it even easier to use.</p>

It was a great read, I definitely laughed out loud every chapter. My wife was not amused. Reading this book put me back on track for my 2015 goal of 2 books a month.</p>

      <p>One of my goals for 2015 is to read 2 books a month. I made this goal towards the end of the January, so I&rsquo;m pretty pleased to say I got one book done in January, and two in the first seven days of February. Now I just need to finish another one to get my average back on track. I&rsquo;ve been getting copies of these books from my local library.</p>
